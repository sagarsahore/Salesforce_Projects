A customer contacts FinServe via the portal to report an unauthorized transaction. The **Einstein Bot** verifies identity and gathers details, flagging the case as **high priority** using **Einstein Case Classification**.

- **Einstein Prediction Builder** forecasts low customer satisfaction if the issue isn't resolved quickly. The case is routed to a senior fraud specialist.
- During the resolution process, **Einstein Next Best Action** suggests recommending an upgrade to a premium fraud protection plan.
- After resolution, **Einstein Sentiment Analysis** reviews customer feedback, logging a positive sentiment in real-time dashboards created in **Einstein Analytics**.
