# IMDB Clone in Salesforce üèÜüé¨

## Role: Salesforce Developer

In this project, I worked as a **Salesforce Developer** to create an **IMDB Clone** using **Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC)** and **Salesforce App Builder**. The goal was to build a comprehensive movie management system, enabling users to interact with movies, actors, genres, and reviews. This project focuses on creating custom objects, relationships, dynamic pages, and reports while integrating business logic and automation to ensure seamless operations.
